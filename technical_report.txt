Technical Report: Country Explorer Application
===========================================

1. API Selection and Implementation
---------------------------------

Primary API: REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/)

API Endpoints Utilized:
- GET /v3.1/all: Fetches all countries
- GET /v3.1/name/{name}: Searches countries by name
- GET /v3.1/region/{region}: Filters countries by region
- GET /v3.1/alpha/{code}: Retrieves specific country by code

2. Technical Challenges and Solutions
-----------------------------------

a) API Response Handling
   Challenge: Inconsistent data structures between endpoints and occasional missing data.
   Solution: 
   - Implemented data normalization layer in api.js
   - Added null checks for optional fields
   - Created fallback values for missing data
   - Standardized error handling across all API calls

b) Performance Issues
   Challenge: Loading and rendering large datasets caused performance issues.
   Solution:
   - Implemented skeleton loading screens
   - Optimized re-renders using React.memo
   - Added error boundaries for better error handling
   - Implemented lazy loading for images


c) Dark Mode Implementation
   Challenge: Consistent theme switching and persistence.
   Solution:
   - Created ThemeContext using React Context API
   - Used localStorage for theme persistence
   - Implemented system preference detection
   - Added smooth transitions between themes

5. Testing Strategy
------------------

Implemented Tests:
- Unit tests for API service functions
- Component tests using React Testing Library
- Integration tests for search and filter functionality
- Accessibility tests for core components
